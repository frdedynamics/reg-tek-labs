********************************************************
Lab 3, PID control, with feed forward, of pendulum
********************************************************

Time and place
==============================================
- Room TBD at TBD

Equipment
==============================================
- Matlab and Simulink
- Handout model in .slx file



Description
==============================================
In this lab you will add a feed forward term to a PID and tune a PID to control the position of a simulated pendulum.


The pendulum model can be a fun challenge for three reasons

    #. It`s non-linear, the torque from gravity is dependant on the pendulum position
    #. It`s in every single control theory book
    #. The pendulum is simple, easy to get our head around, but still an advanced control problem


The overall workflow for you to do is

    #. Open the Simulink model (.slx)
    #. Run it
    #. Have fun
    #. Tune the PID manually
    #. Write a feed forward term to compensate for gravity
    #. Analyse work done by FF and PID
    #. Learn

Steps
==============================================


 #. Open the .slx file on your laptop

    #. Add feed-forward
    #. Tune PID

 #. Run the test, get a score.

     #. Happy? Done. Else, keep tuning, ask questions, take the opportunity to understand control theory.
